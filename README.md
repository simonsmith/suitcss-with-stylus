# SUIT CSS with Stylus

This is a working example of mixing Stylus and SUIT CSS.

SUIT is an awesome way to structure components but I personally miss parts of Sass and LESS etc. By combining it with Stylus and Gulp it allows things like functions and nesting to come back whilst also harnessing the tools that SUIT provides.

#### Why Stylus?

It plays nice with the `--` custom property prefix and also allows `@imports` to be escaped with `@css {}` which is critical if you intend on using rework-npm.
