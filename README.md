# SUIT CSS with Stylus

This is a working example of mixing Stylus and SUIT CSS.

SUIT is an awesome way to structure components but I personally miss parts of Sass and LESS etc. By combining it with Stylus it allows things like mixins and nesting to come back whilst also harnessing the tools that SUIT provides.

This is very much a WIP idea
